# PURPOSE

The purpose of this project is to use VBA to analyze green stocks and determine the stocks that performed well.
We will also refactor our VBA script to see how this affects the performance of our script.

# RESULTS
1. In the year 2017, TERP is the only stock with a negative return. Stocks such as DQ, ENPH, FSLR, and SEDG have returns that surpass 100%
